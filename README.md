# Overview
This is a nodeJS server and a web page that has a javascript file with code in it

I wrote this code to teach myself how to set up a nodeJS server and how to handle fetch requests using said server.
I then took it step further and made a web page that needed to interact with the code, effectively making a complete though shallow front end
and backend connect.

# Development Environment

I used VS code as the text editor and IDE, the Node JS npm software, as well as the express node, and the cors node.

I used javascript, the Node js framework for javascript, and html for this project.
